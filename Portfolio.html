        The first painting, still unnamed, inspired by nature, is a work in progress that Andrea is working on 
        for a gallery show next summer. She and a friend are putting together a multimedia art show in their home town of Gjøvik, 
        at Drengestua at Gjøvik gård, with a bright nature inspired theme. They are an art collective known as Ulvalde, and this is their 
        first big project. They are inspired by artists that aren't afraid to use too much color, such as David Hockney, as well as Tove Jansson.

        The second painting "mummidalen" is from a project Andrea is working on to reinterpret her collection of Mummi 
        cups into paintings that she can give away to friends and decorate her appartment with. She has a large collection of highly desirable
        Mummi cups, and is working on paintings inspired by all of them.

        The third photo is of a paper maché elephant that Andrea made in kindergarten, and it is one of her most prized possessions. During this periode
        Andrea produced a large body of work in the paper maché medium, and this is just one example of many different paper maché animals
        that are on display in different King homes around the globe.
        It is proudly displayed in her living room.</aside>
