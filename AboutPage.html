    <h1>Preparations</h1>
    <p> Our preparations for semantic tags started with a site map. Some of the tags we knew we would need in order to make a page at all,
      such as html, head, and body. After sketching out a site map, we then had an idea of what
      kinds of semantic tags and elements we would need. We knew we would need a nav bar and a header, as well as different elements such as aside,
    headers, articles, and so on. Our rough drafts for the site also included a layout that would require either columns or grid use. 
    <br>We decided to make a CV/personal website for a member of our group, combining some of her actual work and life, and some things that we made up.
    One of the difficulties we encountered was keeping our website true to the site map and sketches, as we are still learning html and css, 
    and some of the elements and tags we learned as we went along.</p>

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> We decided to use these parts in our website in order to organize the information we're presenting, for it to be easier to read. Since our website
      is intended to be viewed in a web browser, a paragraph that is as wide as the screen might be hard to follow. In addition, we know that
      for a personal website, you want to be short and to the point, in order to catch peoples attention, especially on the home page.
      <br>The website includes colors in different shades of blue and green, which are Andrea's favorite colors. These colors are also calm colors,
      which describes Andrea as a person. 
      The quote from the Notebook on the Homepage, has meant a lot for Andrea growing up. The Notebook has been her favorite movie since she was a kid,
      because she used to watch it every week with her siblings. 
      <br>In order to style the navigation bar, we put it in the code as a list element. The navigation bar list got a class, which we used to make the list horizontal. 
      In the beginning, we tried styling the navigation bar using an id, but that resulted in style problems with the hobbies list at the end of the page.
      Therefore, we changed from id to class, which can be used on multiple parts, and solved the problem. 
      <br>One of the things we struggled
      with the most was integrating our html and css in an organized way. We also learned that it is best not to have multiple style sheets,
      but as mentioned, to use classes in stead, which we decided to leave as is (because it was working), but in the future we will do it differently.
      We experimented with grids and columns a good deal, and even though we landed on not using them, we have now learned how to use them.
